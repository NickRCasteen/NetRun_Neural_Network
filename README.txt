	>> recommended to start wtih 2GB of memory for Java

	$ java -Xmx2048m Neural_Network_MAIN_BEGIN_HERE

================= UNTESTED ISSUES ==================

	>> The follwoing issues are figured but untested:
		>> The Saved Model csv file may export incorrectly if a Saved Model csv file already exists. Recommend deleting currently existing csv
